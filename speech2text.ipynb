    "1. Configure Microphone (For external microphones): It is advisable to specify the microphone during the program to avoid any glitches.\n",
    "Type lsusb in the terminal. A list of connected devices will show up. The microphone name would look like this\n",
    "USB Device 0x46d:0x825: Audio (hw:1, 0)\n",
    "Make a note of this as it will be used in the program.\n",

    "2. Set Chunk Size: This basically involved specifying how many bytes of data we want to read at once. Typically, this value is\n",
    "    specified in powers of 2 such as 1024 or 2048.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Set Sampling Rate: Sampling rate defines how often values are recorded for processing.\n",

    "4.Set Device ID to the selected microphone: In this step, we specify the device ID of the microphone that we wish to use in\n",
    "    order to avoid ambiguity in case there are multiple microphones. This also helps debug, in the sense that, while running the\n",
    "    program, we will know whether the specified microphone is being recognized. During the program, we specify a parameter device\n",
    "    _id. The program will say that device_id could not be found if the microphone is not recognized.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Allow Adjusting for Ambient Noise: Since the surrounding noise varies, we must allow the program a second or too to adjust\n",

    "    \n",
    "6. Speech to text translation: This is done with the help of Google Speech Recognition. This requires an active internet \n",
    "    connection to work. However, there are certain offline Recognition systems such as PocketSphinx, but have a very rigorous\n",
    "    installation process that requires several dependencies. Google Speech Recognition is one of the easiest to use."
